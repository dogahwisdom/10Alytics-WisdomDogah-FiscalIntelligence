**Script** (60 seconds):
"This isn't just about fiscal data. This is about the Sustainable Development Goals.

We analyzed $69 billion in fiscal data across 14 African countries. And every insight, every recommendation, every visualization connects directly to advancing the SDGs.

**SDG 1 & 2**—No Poverty, Zero Hunger: We track inflation and food prices. We identify fiscal patterns that affect poverty. We optimize resource allocation so more money goes to programs that actually reduce poverty and hunger.

**SDG 3**—Good Health: We analyze health expenditure patterns. We connect health spending to population data and economic indicators. We help governments spend health dollars more effectively.

**SDG 4**—Quality Education: We analyze revenue and expenditure to identify education financing gaps. We help governments fund education better, so more children get quality education.

**SDG 8**—Economic Growth: This is where our data shines. We analyze GDP growth, unemployment, tax revenue, and trade data. We help governments make decisions that create jobs and grow economies.

**SDG 9**—Infrastructure: We analyze capital expenditure and government debt. We help optimize infrastructure investment so countries build better roads, schools, and hospitals.

**SDG 10**—Reduced Inequalities: We identify fiscal patterns that create or reduce inequality. We recommend progressive resource allocation that ensures everyone benefits.

**SDG 16**—Peace and Justice: This is foundational. We promote transparency. We enable accountability. We strengthen institutions. Without good governance, we can't achieve any other SDG.

Here's the bottom line: Better fiscal intelligence means faster SDG progress. It's that simple. And we've proven it works with real data from 14 countries over 65 years."

**Key Message**: Every insight advances the SDGs.

**Visual Elements**:
- Large, clear SDG icons (official UN design)
- Brief text under each icon showing the connection
- Your brand colors as accent
- Clean, professional layout

**Download SDG Icons**:

## Alternative: SDG Integration Throughout

Instead of a dedicated slide, you can integrate SDG icons into existing slides:

- **Slide 3**: Add SDG icons showing which goals are affected
- **Slide 4**: Show SDG timeline alongside fiscal timeline
- **Slide 6**: Add SDG indicators to each discovery
- **Slide 10**: Show SDG impact alongside financial impact
- **Slide 13**: Prominently display SDG achievement as the goal

**Recommendation**: Use BOTH approaches—dedicated SDG slide PLUS integration throughout for maximum impact.
